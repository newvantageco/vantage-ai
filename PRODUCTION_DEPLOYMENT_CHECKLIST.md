- [ ] Set up health checks
- [ ] Configure alerting (email/Slack)
- [ ] Set up metrics collection

#### Backup Configuration (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Configure automated database backups

- [ ] Set up Redis persistence
- [ ] Configure Redis eviction policy

### Application Performance
- [ ] Configure appropriate worker processes
- [ ] Set up static file caching
- [ ] Configure CDN (if applicable)
- [ ] Enable gzip compression

## üîç Testing & Validation

### Functional Testing
- [ ] User registration/login works
- [ ] AI content generation works
- [ ] Social media platform connections work
- [ ] Publishing to platforms works
- [ ] Billing/subscription flows work (if enabled)
- [ ] File uploads work

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Load test API endpoints
- [ ] Test concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] Verify response times under load
- [ ] Test database performance under load

### Security Testing
- [ ] Test authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works
- [ ] Test CORS policy enforcement
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Test SQL injection prevention

## üö® Emergency Procedures
